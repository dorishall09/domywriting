## The Back Pack
If you don't expect glamour from online bookstores, The Back Pack won't disappoint. That said, they've recently re-launched their website, where they specialize in offering rare out-of-print textbooks. This marketplace has been in operation since 1990. If you need advice, their customer service presence is strong, and they are planning to diversify the products they offer in the near future.
Times have changed thanks to the prolific nature of the Internet. If you wanted to find homeschool books for sale in the 80s and 90s, you'd have to hope that your local bookseller had the titles you needed. Now, if a business doesn't stock what you need, there's another one just a click away that offers free delivery. Embrace the competitive nature of this market, and get the best deal for you and your child today.
